# Customer Churn Analysis Using Excel

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a fictitious telecom company, **Databel**, using **Excel**. Customer churn is a critical metric for subscription-based businesses, as it directly impacts revenue and growth. The objective of this analysis is to explore the dataset, identify key factors contributing to customer churn, and present findings in a clear, actionable manner.

## Project Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis begins with an exploratory examination of the dataset to understand its structure and key characteristics. During this phase, various variables are reviewed to identify initial trends and correlations related to customer churn.

### 2. In-Depth Churn Investigation
Leveraging advanced Excel functions, we proceed to a deeper investigation of churn patterns. By creating **calculated fields** and **PivotTables**, we can uncover significant trends and determine factors that might influence customers to leave **Databel**.

### 3. Dashboard Creation and Reporting
In the final step, the insights gathered from the analysis are compiled into a **dashboard-style sheet**. The goal is to present the findings in a coherent and visually appealing format, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the results and make informed decisions on reducing churn rates.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of **Excel** for conducting a comprehensive customer churn analysis. By following a structured approach, the analysis provides insights into churn behavior, helping businesses understand customer retention challenges and develop effective strategies to address them.
